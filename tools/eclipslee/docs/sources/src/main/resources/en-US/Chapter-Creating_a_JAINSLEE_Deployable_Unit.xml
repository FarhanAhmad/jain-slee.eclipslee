	<title>Creating a JAIN SLEE Deployable Unit</title>
	<para>In order to create a Deployable Unit, the Restcomm Deployable Unit Plugin for Maven is to be used. Unfortunately the EclipSLEE plugin is not yet integrated with third-party Maven tools, and so this must be made manually.</para>
	<important>
		<title>Requirements</title>
		<para>For this to work, Maven must be installed and JBOSS_HOME env var set to point to where Restcomm' JBoss AS is installed. See <xref linkend="jboss_home_setup" /> on how to do this.</para>
	</important>
	<para>In a terminal window, head to the project folder and run the following command: <command>mvn clean install</command>.</para>
	<para>
		The output should be similar to the following:
<screen>
...
[INFO] Executing tasks
     [copy] Copying 1 file to /Users/ammendonca/work/jboss/server/default/deploy
...
[INFO] ----------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESSFUL
[INFO] ----------------------------------------------------------
...
</screen>
	</para>
	<para>At this time, the deployable unit descriptor and the JAR file have been created successfully and deployed to JBoss.</para>
