Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure that the following jar file is present:

  lib/slee-tasks.jar

If it is not present then it will be necessary to build the following project
first:

  org.mobicents.eclipslee.ant - slee-tasks.jar
  
Build instructions are contained in the root folder for that project.  Generally
speaking, it will only be necessary to build this project once.
  
Additionally, xerces.jar must be present in the Plug-In's root folder.  This
jar is used both to compile the Plug-In (it must be in the Project's Java Build
Path) and by the Plug-In when it is run.

Optionally, lib/slee.jar and lib/jain_slee-1_0-fr-api.zip may be present.  See
lib/README for further details.

Building
--------

This project uses the Eclipse build system and should automatically build on opening.  
If it does not, open the Project menu and select Build Project.

Testing
-------

The Plug-In can be tested by right clicking on "build.properties" and choosing "Run As"
-> "Run" from the drop down menu.  This will start a new instance of Eclipse with the
Plug-In installed into it.
