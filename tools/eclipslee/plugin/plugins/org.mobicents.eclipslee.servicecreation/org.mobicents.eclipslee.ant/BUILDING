Prerequisites
-------------

If you wish to view the sources in Eclipse without red squiggles ensure that ant.jar
is in the project's library path.  Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries

Building
--------

Execute the ant build script.  The default target will compile, build and copy the
slee-tasks.jar into the org.mobicents.eclipslee project.
