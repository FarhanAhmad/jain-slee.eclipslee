slee-src.jar

  Contains the source for version 1.0 of the javax.slee packages.  This source has two 
  uses.  Firstly, it contains the Javadoc used by the Plug-In for the javax.slee 
  packages.  Secondly, it can be compiled and packaged up to form slee.jar.

slee.jar  (optional)

  This can be extracted from jain_slee-1_0-fr-api.zip.  If slee.jar is not provided here the user
  will be prompted for the location of jain_slee-1_0-fr-api.zip on using the plug-in.

jain_slee-1_0-fr-api.zip  (optional)

  If this is not provided here the user will be prompted for its location on using the plug-in.
  Note that there may be license issues that prevent this ZIP (and slee.jar) from being
  distributed with the plug-in (in both binary and source form).  This file may be downloaded
