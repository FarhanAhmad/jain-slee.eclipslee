This archive contains two projects:

  org.mobicents.eclipslee.ant
  org.mobicents.eclipslee

The first is a collection of ant tasks used to build and package JAIN SLEE
components, such as deployable unit jars, SBB jars, etc.  The project builds
a single jar file containing the ant tasks.  This jar file is then copied
into the eclipslee project where it is bundled with the plug-in.

The second is the main plug-in project.  The plug-in allows users to create
and build JAIN SLEE components via a series of wizards.  The user may then 
add functionality to the framework created by the plugin to create services.
Components created by the plug-in deploy into any compliant SLEE.

See the files BUILDING and LICENSE in each of the project directories for
build instructions and license details.
